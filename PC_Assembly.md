On that day, we attended a PC Assembly class accompanied by our Technology, Information and System's lecturer, Dr Aryati binti Bakri.
In this session, we were split into a few groups before the briefing about how to assemble and disassemble CPU components. 
It was conducted by a few staffs as well. It was a valuable hands-on experience and opportunity to see and handle the components physically, not just theoretically. 
It enhanced my understandings and gave me a clear version of what we usually learn in lectures. After the session, we also had a quiz to recap about what we learn during the assembly.
