I was fortunate enough to visit  Festival of Idea (FOI) 2025 at PICC, Putrajaya. For me, this was such a great chance I ever got. 

This event aimed at showcasing ideas and making higher education more accessible to the public and promoting Malaysia as a hub for intellectual discourse and innovation at both regional and global levels, 

I got to see the innovative projects, exhibitions and creation. We also attended a few forums like Higher Education Minister's Forum and New Trends & Future Prospects of the AI-Driven Digital Economy Forum.

Events like this really sparked curiosity and encouraged thinking about your own ideas or goals.
